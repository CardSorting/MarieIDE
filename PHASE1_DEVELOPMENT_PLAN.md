```

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Rust (Tauri) + SQLite
- **Editor**: Monaco Editor
- **AI**: OpenAI/Anthropic APIs
- **Version Control**: Git (libgit2)
- **Terminal**: PTY integration
- **Testing**: Vitest + Playwright

## 🎯 Performance Targets

### Startup Performance
- **Cold Start**: <2 seconds
- **Warm Start**: <1 second
- **Memory Usage**: <300MB baseline
- **CPU Usage**: <5% idle, <25% during editing

### File Operations
- **File Open**: <200ms for files up to 1MB
- **File Save**: <100ms for typical sizes
- **Checkpoint Create**: <2 seconds for projects up to 1000 files
- **Checkpoint Restore**: <3 seconds for full project restore

### AI Operations
- **Prompt Processing**: <10 seconds for typical requests
- **Response Streaming**: <100ms latency
