# MarieIDE - AI-First Development Environment

**An autonomous AI-driven development environment that revolutionizes software development through intelligent code generation and management.**

## 🎯 Vision

MarieIDE is not just another IDE - it's a complete paradigm shift toward AI-first development. Instead of building traditional editing tools, we focus on creating an intelligent system that can understand, generate, and manage code autonomously while providing minimal human interfaces for oversight and guidance.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🤖 **AI-First Architecture**
- **Multi-Model Orchestration**: Intelligent selection and management of multiple AI models
- **Context Understanding**: Automatic analysis and comprehension of entire codebases
- **Autonomous Operations**: >80% of routine development tasks handled without human intervention

### 🧠 **Intelligent Code Generation**
- **Natural Language to Code**: Describe what you want to build in plain English
- **Visual Code Creation**: Generate code from diagrams, sketches, and wireframes
- **Context-Aware Generation**: AI understands your project structure and coding patterns

### ⚡ **Autonomous Workflows**
- **Self-Managing Development**: AI handles feature development, testing, and optimization
- **Intelligent Bug Fixing**: Automatic detection, analysis, and resolution of issues
- **Continuous Optimization**: Self-improving code quality and performance

### 🎯 **Minimal Human Interface**
- **AI-Optimized Display**: Interface designed for AI collaboration, not manual editing
- **Seamless Handoff**: Smooth transition between autonomous AI and human control
- **Intelligent Oversight**: Human guidance only when truly needed

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: 18.0.0 or higher
- **npm**: 9.0.0 or higher
- **Git**: Required for autonomous version control

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/marieide/marieide.git
cd marieide

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up AI models (optional - will use cloud models by default)
npm run setup:ai

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### First Run

1. **Launch MarieIDE**: The application will initialize AI systems automatically
2. **Open a Project**: Use "Open Project" to analyze an existing codebase
3. **Start Building**: Describe what you want to create in natural language
4. **Watch AI Work**: See the AI understand, generate, and optimize your code

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components
